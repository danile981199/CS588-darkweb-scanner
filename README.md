Mark Urbin – Requirements, scanning tool, test environments, and test data sets.   
Xiangyu Xu – GUI development, dashboard, data analysis.   
 
Week-by-Week Plan   
 
Phase 1: Planning & Research 
- Define clear project requirements and scope (Mark)   
- Research ethical guidelines, laws, and security measures (Sanket)   
- Identify tools and frameworks (Python, Scrapy, Tor, VPN, Kibana, etc.) (All) 
 
Week 2 
- Develop a basic architecture diagram (Mark) 
- Design data collection strategy (Sanket) 
- Wireframe/mockup of GUI dashboard (Xiangyu) 
 
Week 3 
- Finalize the test environment setup (Mark) 
- Define and document risk mitigation strategies (Sanket) 
- Build initial GUI structure using Django/React (Xiangyu) 
 
Phase 2: Development & Testing 
Week 4 
- Develop basic web scraping script (without live scanning) (Sanket & Mark) 
- Set up VPN and Tor configurations for anonymity testing (Mark) 
- Implement user authentication in the GUI (Xiangyu) 
 
Week 5  
- Refine scanning tool with selective and randomized scanning (Sanket & Mark)   
- Test sandboxed environments for safe testing (Mark)   
- Connect GUI to backend (Xiangyu)   
 
Week 6 
- Implement basic data processing for scanned text (Sanket) 
- Test security of the scanning tool (check for any breadcrumbs) (Mark) 
- Develop data visualization components for the dashboard (Xiangyu) 
 
Week 7  
- Improve anonymity features (IP rotation, random scan intervals) (Sanket & Mark) 
- Implement basic PII detection algorithms (Sanket) 
- Debug GUI and ensure smooth data display (Xiangyu) 
 
Week 8 
- Conduct a full test run in a sandboxed environment (All) 
- Debug and optimize scanning performance (Sanket & Mark) 
- Finalize dashboard UI with real test data (Xiangyu) 
 
Phase 3: Refinement & Finalization 
Week 9 
- Conduct security audits (test for leaks, verify anonymity) (Sanket & Mark) 
- Improve search filtering and analytics in the dashboard (Xiangyu) 
- Finalize documentation on tool usage and security practices (All) 
 
Week 10 
- Final test with ethical scanning on the dark web (Sanket & Mar*) 
- Conduct a final GUI usability test (Xiangyu) 
- Make necessary improvements based on test results (All) 
 
Week 11 
- Prepare project report and presentation materials (All) 
- Double-check all security measures before the final submission (Sanket & Mark) 
- Run last debugging tests for GUI (Xiangyu) 
 
Week 12  
Key Notes: 
Testing will be done in a controlled environment before any real-world scanning. 
Security measures will be prioritized at every stage to avoid leaving breadcrumbs.
